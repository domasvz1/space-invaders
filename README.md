 # the Idea behind this
 
 The idea behind this project is to make it as unique as possible. That is why I've chosen to write this without any additional packages, only used sprites found online for graphics, no assets used.
 
- While making this game, I decided to take some assets from the suggested ones by Unity, music, shaders, textures, models for the game itself.

Remaking my Unity project, this used to cars, now remaking this to space invaders, since I had somehwta good level system implemented and gameobjects/other scripts which might be useable for space invaders.


Right now the main menu is in fixing stage, fix the starting menu "Menu" Scene made it responsive


# Features [will need to be documented soon here]

- This could probably be released later (split into releases)


Will upload screenshots from this game later.


# What is letf to do here

Implement enemy arrays 

Annoying things... 

well this took me an hour to figure out.. my movemnt of rigidbody is x y and not z, when using Vector3. This might be handy for anyone using this someday
