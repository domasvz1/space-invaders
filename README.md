 # the Idea behind this
 
 The idea behind this project is to make it as unique as possible. That is why I've chosen to write this without any additional packages, only used sprites found online for graphics, no assets used.

Remaking my Unity project, this used to cars, now remaking this to space invaders, since I had somehwta good level system implemented and gameobjects/other scripts which might be useable for space invaders.


Right now the main menu is in fixing stage, fix the starting menu "Menu" Scene made it responsive



Will upload screenshots from this game later.
